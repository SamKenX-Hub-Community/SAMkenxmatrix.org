The future lies in education. This is a critical place to teach about how open
source can have a positive social impact, but it would be very ironic not to use
open source there!

- Martin Dougiamas, CEO of Moodle, covers the history of the open source
  platform for teaching Moodle. He will tell us why open source, why it matters
  in education, and share his views on the future of technology and humanity.
- Dominik George will tell us everything about their school management system
  AlekSIS, currently deployed in schools in Germany. We may have a glimpse of
  his activities for teckids if time allows!
